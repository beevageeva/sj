<h1>Validation</h1>
There are 2 types of validation: the validation that is made in the page(when pressing next , prev or ok) for the fields 
that are only in that page and the final validation(made at final when pressing ok) for the fields that are not all in 
the same configuration page.<br><br>
<B>Validations made : </B>
<ul>
	<li>for the caches(including main memory)(third panel of configuration)
		<ul>
			<li>if the cache is enabled the number of entries must be between 2 and 2**32</li>
			<li>the block size must be between 2 and 2**20</li>
			<li>the number of sets must be between 1 and number of entries </li>
			<li>the bus size must be between 8 and 128 </li>
			<li>the cache access time units must be between 0 and 50000 </li>
			<li>the block size of the caches must be less or equal to the page size of the main memory<br>
			(In this case it is assumed that the caches have the same block size.)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>for the memory configuration(first panel of configuration)
		<ul>
			<li>the maximum number of processes that can be loaded must be between 1 and 2**8</li>
			<li>Total number number of virtual pages must be greater or equal to the number<br>
			of real pages(the number of entries in the main memory)</li>
			<li>Virtual address size must be less or equal to 32</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>for the page table(second panel of configuration)
	<br>if is direct mapped
	<ul>
	<li>the number of levels must be between 1 and the number of virtual pages for each process</li>
	<li>the sum of offset lengths must be equal to the number of virt pages for each process</li>
	</ul>
	if is inverse mapped
	<ul><li>the hash anchor size must be greater or equal than the number of entries in the main memory and<br>
	less or equal than the total number of virtual pages</li></ul>
	</li>
</ul>
