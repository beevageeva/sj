<h1>Table columns</h1>

Cache table(this includes tlb and main memory)default fields:
<ul>
	<li>i : the entry number</li>
	<li>KEY : the cache address . In the case of main memory this is the page number</li>
	<li>m : 1 if the block was modif , 0 if not , - if it is an instr entry</li>
	<li>pid : the number of process that referenced this page</li>	
	
	<p>The following fields will appear due to a specific type of cache:
	<li>TAG , SET :  tag . The address decomp in TAG|SET|OFFSET . Fully associative caches have only one set (SET number of bits is 0 )
	and direct mapped caches have for each entry in the cache a different set.
	For the tlb there is no offset(the address is the virt address) and for the caches the key entry is comp by 
	TAG and SET that repr the real page/block number . This fields does not appear in fully associative cache models.
	</li>
	<li>type :  only appear in caches that have data and instruction separated.The value of this field can be I or D</li>
	<li>VAL : This field appear only when the value stored in the cache has some importance : in this
	case for the TLB cache where stores the real page number corresp to a virtual page number
	</li>
	
	<p> The following fields appear depending of the eviction policy used:
	<li>ni : with OPT  policy  - is the number of instruction in the current process trace when the block/page is 
	put in the cache.In this way the algorithm can see what instruction in the trace file has the same virtual memory
	address reference</li>
	<li>timestamp :  the timestamp used in FIFO alg  </li>
	<li>notUsed: used in MRU(Most Recently Used) and LRU(Least Recently Used) - a counter for the times other blocks
	of the cache are referenced(read , write)</li>
	<li>used: appears for LFU(Least Frequently Used) and NFU(Not Frequently Used) policy - a counter for the times this block
	is referenced(read , write)</li>
	<li>r :appears in  NRU(Not Recently Used) policy - is 1 if the block is read, 0 otherwise
	 and in  NFU policy - is 1 if the block is referenced (read , write) , 0 otherwise</li>
	 </ul>
<p>

The block that will be evicted will be :
<ul>
<li>for LFU policy : the entry that has tne min value for used field</li>
<li>for LRU policy : the entry that has the max value for notUsed field</li>
<li>for MRU policy : the entry that has the min value for notUsed field

</li>
<li>for NFU policy : the entry that has min value for used+r</li>
<li>for NRU policy :   
The entries are divided in 4 classes : not read and not modified , not read and modified,
read and not modified , read and modified.The block to evict is chosen ranmdomly from the first(defined by this order)
class that have one or more entries.</li>
<li>for Random policy : a random entry</li>
<li>for FIFO policy : the entry that entered first in the cache (that has the min value for timestamp)</li>
<li>for OPT policy : the entry that has max value for (the index of the next instruction in the trace file for this process that has the
same virtual memory reference(counting from the current instruction index in the trace file) / TUnits(configurated for this process))

<p>
The region in the cache where the alg will look in order to evict a page will be defined by
the type of cache:
<ul>
<li>if it's data/instructions separated</li>
<li>if it's set-associative :  will look only for the entries in the same set as the node that has to be put</li>
<li>if the memory allocation policy is local : will look only for the pages of the same process</li></ul>
