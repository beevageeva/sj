<h1>Memory allocation</h1>
In the main memory there are 2 policies  for allocating memory:
<p><b>global</b>
There is no previous page allocation for each process . Each process allocate a page in the main memory when needed
even if he has to evict a page from other process.
<p><b>local</b>
For each process that must add , first the mem alloc check if it has free pages (must be at least a page for each region 
in the memory . The region are specified in different ways : for example in general for a cache if it is set associative with
n sets rhere will be n regions depending of the set number, or by data and instr separation that will define 2 regions ).
That is the reason for in this case with an inverse mapped page table(that makes the main memory fully associative : 
numberOfSets = numberOfEntries in the main memory)only one process can be in the memory.
If there are free pages(they are empty and not between the pages needed by a process)these will
be allocated to this process and marked as needed by this process.
Then will try to get other empty entries in the main memory not needed by other processes in order 
to achieve an equal number of pages.
<p>PFF policy<BR>
A thread will be run after NEvNodesToBeRun(from config)  will be evicetd from the cache.
For each process the page  fault frequency is defined that is the number of the page evicted since the last run.
If the page  fault frequency gets higher than maxPFF(from config) , the mem alloc searches a random
process that has the page fault frequency lower than minPFF(from config) anf has pages not needed,
takes a page from this process that allocates to the  first.
