<h1>Page aging</h1>
The page aging is a thread run after mem ref (from config) references(read or write) were made in the main memory.
Every page in the memory has an age that initially is 0.With every reference to it(read or write) its age is incremented 
with ref inc units(from config) units.When the thread runs , it will remove the pages that have an age less or equal to 0
and will decrease the age of each page (that is not empty entry)
