<h1>Process scheduling</h1>
When adding a process , a number of time units must be specified.
The processes can be in 2 queues : the waiting queue and the executing queue.
When a process starts execution in the exec queue 
it will stay in this state as long as his TUnits(from config when adding a process)>=0 
and it hasn't a memory page fault
For each accesscache/memory access a number of access time units is also defined.
When executing this time units will be decremented from the TUnits of the process
currently executing and from the TUnits of the first process from the waiting queue.
When the TUnits of the currently executing process becomes < 0 the currently exec process becomes the last
element of the executing queue , so the next process in the queue will exec.
When a mem page fault occurs , the currently exec will become the last element in the waiting queue
having to stay there for TUnits = diskAccessTimeUnits.
When TUnits for the first process in the waiting queue < 0 this 
will become the last element of the exec queue.
