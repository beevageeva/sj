<p><b>DIRECT MAPPED</b><BR>
The direct mapped page table is hierarchical , suppose N = number of levels.The virtual page number(in binary representation) is 
divided in N parts . Each part has a length as defined in configuration as lengths.(note that the sum of the lengths must be equal
to the number of bits used to represent the virtual page number).
When searching in the page table for a virtual page number there can be 2 methods
<p><b>bottom-up</b>
This method only makes sense with TLB enabled (because the idea is to put in the tlb , in the case of a tlb miss also the 
addresses of the page tables that should query from the botom most level up to the first level ),
that is why if the tlb is not enabled the top-down method is used<BR>
Define the virtual address of a page table:<br>
There are N levels to wich we add level 0 that is the root page table for each process :
So we have ROOT , L(0)(root page table for each process) , L(1) , ... L(N)<BR>
l(1),..l(N) are the offset lenhgth for each level ; l(0) = maxNumberOfProcesses<BR>
o(1),..o(N) are the offset values for each level ; o(0) = pid<BR>
Define N(i) the number of page tables for each level = 0..N
N(i)=2**(l(0)+...l(i))
In order to define a virtual address for a page table we calculate the index of the page table in the whole array of
page tables(supposing that they are allocated linear and considering all the tree created : an offset in a page table 
is the index in the array of page tables in the next level referenced by all the  entries in this page table) 
Define B(i) the number of page tables that are before this page table in level i(0..N)<BR>
B(0) = o(0)<BR>
B(i) = (2** l(i-1)) *  B(i-1) + o(i-1)<BR>
Thus the virtual address of the page table in level i(for i in 0..N) is:<BR>
1+N(0)+..N(i-1)+B(i)<BR>
Should take care that the virtual addresses of the page tables don´t mess with the virtual addresses of the trace files
(this virtual memory should be considered reserved)
<p><b>top-down</b>

<p><b>INVERSE MAPPED</b><BR>
Each virtual page can be mapped to a unique physical frame because the virtual page number is hashed(%) to
the number of pages from the memory.Thus , many virtual page numbers can be mapped to the same physical page number.
In the page table appear all the virtual page number yet mapped to a phys page number(the one that is actually loaded in
in the memory is marked with a 1).The hash anchor makes the collision chain shorter when searching for a
virtual page number in the page table.<br>
If the alocation policy is local(each process has a number of pages allocated and cannot allocate pages in 
other process area)only one process can be at a det time in the memory.
